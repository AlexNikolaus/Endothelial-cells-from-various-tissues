# Endothelial-cells-from-various-tissues
The project involves integrating different scRNA-seq endothelial cell datasets and testing for differential expression of genes within organs/clusters. A total of ~12000 cells from different tissues (adipose tissue, colon, pancreatic islets, s. nigra, testis, prostate, mesenteric arteries) were analyzed.
The process involved removing the metadata from the individual scRNA-seq datasets, merging them into one object, running Harmony for integration, and performing clustering & visualisation on the resulting dataset.
